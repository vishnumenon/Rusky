This app was created for the HackNC fall 2015 hackathon. The purpose of the app is to provide both the owners and the patrons of food trucks locational data.
The user simply requests that a food truck come to his location. All of the requests for every user for every food truck is analysed to calculate the best location for
food trucks to set up shop based on user data.
